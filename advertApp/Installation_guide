Most of string values are written in greek like the initial description received for the app.

For testing the functionality of the application I used the XAMPP and created the folder inside the vhost folder where most of my projects are located. I used the http://localhost/advertApp/public/index.php link to access the initial "login" page and after user login I redirected towards the main.php page.

To install the application:

Download the zip file and unzip it. Change the "advertApp-main" foldername to "advertApp" and place it if you are going to use XAMPP in the vhosts folder. example path (C:\xampp\htdocs\vhosts\advertApp..).

From the phpMyAdmin create a login profile: HostIp = "127.0.0.1" Username = "realEstate" Password = "password" DatabaseName = "realestate"

In addition with the above login profile you have to create the database and import the database from the file RE_adv.sql which is located in the Database folder.

I had a lot of fun creating this application and for sure there are ton of improvements that can be made or even improvements.
